## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

# Activate virtual environment (Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# To deactivate the virtual environment, run:
deactivate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure VS Code
In Visual Studio Code, change the Python environment by selecting the virtual environment `venv` in the bottom toolbar.
